This code when ran will web scrape a website that will look for artists in the title or just the artist name and compile a list of songs and send an email to of your choosing. To send an email to yourself or test it, create a separate credentials.json file that includes
{ 
"to": "your name <your email>"
"from": "the email you are using"
"sender_email": "email you are sending to"
"sender_password": "16 character code from app password on gmail"
}
